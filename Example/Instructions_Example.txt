Files in this directory describe the generation of exposure values and the simulation of transmission bottlenecks for the office environment.

./0_restore.sh

This resets the files in the directory.  Note the files in the Data/Office directory.

./1_run_office_exposures.sh

This generates exposure values for the office environment, calculating exposure levels for particles of radii from 1 to 500um.  The code may take approximately 20-30 minutes to run depending on your machine.  Output files are stored

./2_get_bottlenecks.sh

This calculates simulated bottleneck sizes from the exposure files.  A total of 10^6 simulations are run for a variety of effective viral loads.  This script may also take around 20-30 minutes.

./3_process_filenames.sh

This performs some simple renaming of files for consistency

./4_process_bottlenecks.sh

This rearranges the bottleneck size data into a more readable format using a perl script.


Output files:

The final files generated are of the form Data/Office/Bottnecks_Cough_Absorbing_phiX_vm1.dat.count.  A pre-calculated set of files is included in the Example_outputs directory.  They show bottleneck sizes for cases of infection across the simulations that were generated.

The filenames of the output files indicate that the code has been run for the office environment, simulating a cough with standard volume (vm1 i.e. multiplied by 1), with the walls absorbing emitted particles, and with the parameter phi_env set to X.  See Supporting Text for more information about the phi_env parameter.
